        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting probabilities**: After the model produces the probability distribution for the next token, the probabilities are sorted in descending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cumulative sum**: A cumulative sum of these sorted probabilities is calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Probability mass selection**: A threshold p (typically between 0.9 and 1) is chosen. The smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p is selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Sampling**: The next token is randomly sampled from this reduced set of tokens.\n",

        "Which decoding method is *best*? If there is no obvious best, please list the pros/cons/use-cases for each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no obvious \"best\" method when it comes to sampling and it depends on the nature of the application we're building and our compute budget. Examining some pros and cons of each approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Greedy - This sampling method should typically only be used for prediction of very short sequences of tokens (ideally 1-3) because of how much it optimizes for the next token. It optimizes for the short horizon and can lead to issues with longer sequences. However, it is computationally very efficient.\n",
        "2. Sampling from the distribution (no changes) - This method can be a good balance between greedy and more computationally complex methods which may be computationally expensive. If we believe that the learned distribution of the model is decent, then this method might be effective. However, it may lead to some meaningless or repetitive outputs since it has no repetition penalty.\n",
        "3. top-k and top-p - Both of these methods can be a good balance between greedy and sampling. Their use can lead to fewer surprises as they still sample most likely outcomes. However, their use with a low temperature might lead to repetituion. This can be countered with repetition penalty.\n",
        "4. Beam Search - This method is most interesting for predicting long sequences because it optimizes for the joint probabilty of the sequence as opposed to the next token. It may produce some surprising results but they can be countered if it is used together with other parameters like repetion penalty, top-p and topk. The downside is that it is extremely computationally expensive and can still produce some repetitive results.\n",
        "5. Temperature and Repetition Penalty - These are less sampling methods but rather parameters which can be used with other methods. Use of high(er) temperature (>1) can encourage the model to be more creative. Repetition penalty can avoid repeated outputs and counter the \"greedy\" effect in sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "If I had to pick one method only (although I don't know why I would restrict myself in this way), I would probably use top-p with a temperature > 1 and some repetition penalty as a default. However, some tuning would be required depending on the model to find the best defaults."
